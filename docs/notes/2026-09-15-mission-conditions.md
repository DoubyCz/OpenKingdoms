# How a campaign mission is won and lost

Line numbers are anchors into the legacy reference, as in every note here.

## Two lists, not one

A mission file writes its conditions as plain keys inside
`[GlobalHeader]`, next to `numplayers` and `size`. There is no
conditions section and no nesting. The original reads those keys at
:239243-239850 and builds two separate lists.

The victory list, eleven keys, in the order they are read:

- `KillEnemyCommander` :239266
- `DestroyAllUnits` :239280
- `KillAllMobileUnits` :239294
- `BuildUnitType` :239310
- `CaptureUnitType` :239352
- `KillAllOfType` :239391
- `KillUnitType` :239432
- `MoveUnitToRadius` :239474
- `UnitTypePassesX` :239532
- `UnitTypePassesZ` :239590
- `VictoryTimerRunsOut` :239648

The defeat list, seven keys:

- `CommanderKilled` :239663
- `AllUnitsKilled` :239677
- `AllUnitsKilledOfType` :239693
- `UnitTypeKilled` :239734
- `DeathTimerRunsOut` :239776
- `AnyUnitPassesX` :239791
- `AnyUnitPassesZ` :239808

Victory needs every condition in the first list at once, :239922-239950.
With no victory condition at all it never fires. Defeat needs any one
condition in the second list, :239952-239990. The per-player tick reads
victory first and only asks about defeat when victory is not met,
:206640-206672, so a tick that satisfies both is a win. Either verdict
puts a banner over the running battle for 90 ticks at the original's
30 Hz, :206542-206572, and then the statistics screen opens.

## The conditions a mission does not name

Two are filled in at :239825-239851. A mission with no victory
condition gets `DestroyAllUnits`, but only when the game mode is not
campaign, so a campaign mission is left as its file wrote it. A mission
with no defeat condition gets `AllUnitsKilled`. The second is where the
ordinary rule that you lose when you lose everything comes from.

## ANYTYPE

`MoveUnitToRadius`, `UnitTypePassesX` and `UnitTypePassesZ` accept the
literal unit type `ANYTYPE`, which is stored as an empty name and means
any type at all, :239493, :239553, :239611. No shipped mission uses it.

## What the shipped corpus says

74 of the 129 mission files carry placed units. 68 of those name at
least one condition and 6 name none. The most common key by a wide
margin is `AllUnitsKilled`, in 29 files, and it is a defeat condition
every time. `DestroyAllUnits` is next at 22 files and is a victory
condition every time. The two appear together in 14 files, which is
what the split is for: destroy the enemy to win, lose your own army to
lose.

Four keys are read by the original and used by no shipped mission:
`BuildUnitType`, `CaptureUnitType`, `AnyUnitPassesX` and
`AnyUnitPassesZ`. The first two ask whether the player owns a unit of
the named type, which covers building one and capturing one alike. The
last two take a bare coordinate and ask whether any enemy unit has
passed it.

## Missions that name no victory condition

Sixteen of the 48 base missions and seven of the 26 Iron Plague ones
name only defeat conditions. Campaign mode adds no implicit victory
condition, so nothing in the condition lists can win them, and the
engine sets its victory flag in one place only, :206549, reached only
from the victory list.

Those missions are won by their mission script. Every campaign mission
can carry one: the original resolves `Missions\<base>.cob` as asset
slot 2 and loads it at :177668. 63 of them ship, 43 in `missions.hpi`
and 20 in `IPMissions.hpi`, and all 23 of the missions above are among
them. The script engine takes the callbacks `Start`, `UnitCreated`,
`UnitDestroyed`, `TriggerHit` and `Trigger%i`, and offers host
functions including `SetMission` and `SetTrigger`. It is also what the
per-player tick asks before it reads the conditions at all, :206644,
and it is the likely writer of the forced verdict pair on the condition
object that :240090 and :240122 read.

So there is nothing to decide here and no deviation to record. Those
missions become winnable when mission scripting lands. Until then they
run without a way to win, which is the same behaviour the rules above
give them.

## Which side a condition reads

A condition that takes no unit type has to know whose units it counts,
because otherwise the victory key and the defeat key of a pair would
ask the same question. `DestroyAllUnits` and `KillEnemyCommander` read
the enemy. `AllUnitsKilled` and `CommanderKilled` read the player.
`AnyUnitPassesX` and `AnyUnitPassesZ` read the enemy.

A condition that names a unit type does not need the side as well. The
mission author picks the key whose list the named type belongs in, so
`AllUnitsKilledOfType` and `KillAllOfType` ask the same question of the
map and differ only in which list holds the answer. The engine reads
them that way because it cannot yet prove the original narrows them,
and because narrowing them would break any mission whose escorted unit
belongs to a seat other than the player's.
