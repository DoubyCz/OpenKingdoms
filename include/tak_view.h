/*
 * tak_view.h -- the seam between the battle screen and what draws it.
 *
 * A view draws one frame of a read only world into the play area,
 * turns a pointer into a world point and into a unit, and scrolls its
 * own camera. The battle screen holds one active view and forwards to
 * it. The classic renderer is the first view, by delegation to the
 * calls it always made (src/ui/view_classic.c), and the 3D renderer
 * is the second (src/render/view3d.c).
