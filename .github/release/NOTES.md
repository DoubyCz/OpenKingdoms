OpenKingdoms VERSION_HERE, an engine for Total Annihilation: Kingdoms.

Play in a browser at [openkingdoms.net](https://openkingdoms.net), or download below and play on the desktop.

## You bring the game

These archives hold the engine and the SDL runtime it needs. They hold no game content and never will. You need your own copy of Total Annihilation: Kingdoms, from GOG or from the discs.

The first run looks for it in the usual places. If it cannot find yours, it says so and how to point it at the folder. That is remembered afterwards.

## Downloads

| Platform | File |
|---|---|
| Windows 10 and 11, 64 bit | `openkingdoms-VERSION_HERE-windows-x64.zip` |
| macOS, Apple silicon | `openkingdoms-VERSION_HERE-macos-arm64.tar.gz` |
| macOS, Intel | `openkingdoms-VERSION_HERE-macos-x86_64.tar.gz` |
| Linux, x86_64 | `openkingdoms-VERSION_HERE-linux-x86_64.tar.gz` |

`SHA256SUMS` carries the checksums. `HOW-TO-RUN.txt` inside each archive covers the rest.

macOS asks about an unidentified developer, because this build is not signed by Apple. Clear the download flag once with `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine OpenKingdoms`.

Linux binaries are built on Ubuntu 22.04 and need that glibc or newer.

## Multiplayer

Deterministic lockstep over one relay. Browser and desktop players share a room, and the desktop build reaches the same server the browser page does.

## What is missing

The Bink video clips are not decoded in these builds, so the animated menu doors and the intro movie are still. Everything else runs.

Problems go to [issues](https://github.com/OpenKingdoms/OpenKingdoms/issues), with the version line from the main menu.
